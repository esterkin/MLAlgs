**Algorithms**

*baglinclassify.py* - implements the basic linear classifer using a bagging approach.

*mahadist.py* - computes the Mahalanobis distances from the centroid of a set of training points to each point in the testing set.

*linreg.py* -  inputs a training set for multivariate linear regression (a set of M N-dimensional points) and then provides regression parameters for a training set of data points, leading to the regression estimate.

*kerpercep.py* - implementation of a radial basis function (Gaussian) kernel perceptron.

*knn.py* -  implementation of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifer.
